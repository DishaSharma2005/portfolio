## 🚀 About The Project

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my **skills**, **projects**, **experience**, and **achievements** in the field of software development and technology.  
Built with a focus on **clean design**, **smooth animations**, and **responsive layout**, this website reflects my creative and technical journey.

I designed this portfolio with creativity and attention to detail, keeping the Pokémon-inspired theme intact throughout. From colors and icons to animations, every element adds a spark of fun while maintaining a clean, professional aesthetic.
